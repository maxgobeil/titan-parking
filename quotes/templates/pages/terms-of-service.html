        <h2>4. Weather Conditions and Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Line striping and pavement marking are weather-dependent services. We reserve the right to reschedule work due to 
          unsuitable weather conditions (rain, snow, temperatures below 50°F/10°C, or excessively high humidity). We will make 
          reasonable efforts to accommodate your schedule when rescheduling is necessary.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>5. Surface Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise specified in our quote, our services do not include cleaning, power washing, or repairing the surface 
          to be marked. The client is responsible for ensuring that the surface is clean, dry, and in suitable condition for line 
          striping. Additional charges may apply if we need to prepare surfaces that are not ready for marking.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          We warrant our workmanship for a period of 6 months from the date of completion, under normal use conditions. This warranty 
          is limited to the reapplication of markings that show premature wear or failure. This warranty does not cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Damage from snow plowing, chemical spills, or abrasive materials</li>
          <li>Normal wear and tear from vehicle traffic</li>
          <li>Damage from improper surface preparation if not performed by us</li>

        <h2>8. Liability Limitation</h2>
        <p>
          Our maximum liability for any claim arising out of our services shall be limited to the amount paid for the services. 
          We are not liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, including but not limited to loss of use or 
          business interruption.

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>9. Compliance with Regulations</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to comply with all applicable regulations, including CSA B651 requirements for accessible parking. However, the client 
          is ultimately responsible for ensuring their property meets all local, provincial (including Quebec's Act to secure handicapped persons in the exercise of their rights), and federal (Accessible Canada Act) requirements. We can provide guidance but cannot guarantee compliance with all regulatory requirements.
