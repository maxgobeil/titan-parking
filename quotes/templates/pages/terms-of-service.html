        <h2>2. Quotes and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          All quotes provided by us are valid for 30 days from the date of issue, unless otherwise specified. Acceptance of a 
          quote must be confirmed in writing (email is acceptable) before any work will be scheduled. By accepting our quote, 
          you agree to these Terms of Service.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Payment terms are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For projects under $1,000: Payment in full is due upon completion of the work.</li>
          <li>For projects over $1,000: A 50% deposit is required before work begins, with the balance due upon completion.</li>
          <li>Payment methods accepted: Cash, Check, e-Transfer</li>
          <li>Invoices are due within 30 days of issuance. Late payments may incur a fee of 1.5% per month.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3.1 Deposits and Payment Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          For all jobs valued at $2,000 or more, a 50% deposit is required to secure your place in our schedule. For jobs between $1,000-$2,000, a 30% deposit is required. All deposits must be received at least 5 business days prior to the scheduled start date, or the job may be rescheduled. Deposits are non-refundable within 48 hours of the scheduled service date but may be applied to future services if rescheduling is necessary due to weather conditions.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>4. Weather Conditions and Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Line striping and pavement marking are weather-dependent services. We reserve the right to reschedule work due to 
          unsuitable weather conditions (rain, snow, temperatures below 50°F/10°C, or excessively high humidity). We will make 
          reasonable efforts to accommodate your schedule when rescheduling is necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>4.1 Mobilization and Site Access</h2>
        <p>
          Mobilization fees cover the transportation of equipment, materials, and crew to your location for a single scheduled visit. If our crew is unable to complete the work due to circumstances beyond our control (including but not limited to: vehicles parked in work areas, site not being ready as agreed, or client's failure to provide access), a second mobilization fee will be charged for any return visits required to complete the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client is responsible for ensuring that the work area is accessible and clear of vehicles during the scheduled service time. We require that parking lots be at least 90% clear of vehicles during service. Any delay exceeding 30 minutes due to site access issues may result in rescheduling and additional mobilization charges.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>5. Surface Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          The client is responsible for ensuring that the surface is clean, dry, and in suitable condition for line striping at the time of our scheduled arrival. While we offer sweeping and cleaning services that can be included in your quote, these represent conditions at the time of inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          If surface conditions deteriorate between quote acceptance and service date (including but not limited to: new oil spills, mud or dirt accumulation, debris, or construction residue), additional cleaning fees will apply. Our crew will assess the surface condition upon arrival and notify the client of any additional preparation required before proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard cleaning services include light sweeping. Heavy cleaning, power washing, oil spot treatment, or extensive debris removal will incur additional charges based on time and materials required. The client will be notified of these additional charges before work proceeds.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>If you need to cancel scheduled services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancellations made more than 48 hours before the scheduled start time: No cancellation fee</li>
          <li>Cancellations made less than 48 hours before the scheduled start time: 25% of the quoted price may be charged to cover preparation costs.</li>
          <li>If our crew arrives on site and cannot perform the scheduled work due to site conditions, vehicle obstruction, or lack of access, a fee of 50% of the mobilization charge will apply plus any applicable minimum service charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>7. Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          We warrant our workmanship for a period of 6 months from the date of completion, under normal use conditions. This warranty 
          is limited to the reapplication of markings that show premature wear or failure. This warranty does not cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Damage from snow plowing, chemical spills, or abrasive materials</li>
          <li>Normal wear and tear from vehicle traffic</li>
          <li>Damage from improper surface preparation if not performed by us</li>
          <li>Fading due to UV exposure or harsh weather conditions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>8. Liability Limitation</h2>
        <p>
          Our maximum liability for any claim arising out of our services shall be limited to the amount paid for the services. 
          We are not liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, including but not limited to loss of use or 
          business interruption.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>9. Compliance with Regulations</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to comply with all applicable regulations, including CSA B651 requirements for accessible parking. However, the client 
          is ultimately responsible for ensuring their property meets all local, provincial (including Quebec's Act to secure handicapped persons in the exercise of their rights), and federal (Accessible Canada Act) requirements. We can provide guidance but cannot guarantee compliance with all regulatory requirements.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting to our website. 
          Your continued use of our services constitutes agreement to the modified Terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>11. Minimum Service Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Titan Parking maintains a minimum job size requirement of $850 per service call. Projects quoted below this amount will be subject to additional fees to meet this minimum threshold. This minimum reflects the cost of mobilization, equipment setup, and efficient resource allocation required to provide our professional services.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>12. Permits and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          The client is responsible for obtaining any necessary permits or approvals from municipal authorities before line striping work begins. While we strive to meet all accessibility requirements, the client assumes final responsibility for ensuring that the requested layout complies with all local regulations and accessibility standards. Titan Parking can provide guidance on regulatory requirements but cannot be held liable for non-compliance issues resulting from client-approved designs or layouts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>13. Materials and Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>
          Titan Parking uses professional-grade traffic marking paints and materials appropriate for the application surface and intended durability. Standard services include water-based traffic paint suitable for most applications. Premium options, including thermoplastic markings or specialized coatings, are available at additional cost and may be recommended for high-traffic areas or facilities requiring extended durability. Material specifications will be detailed in your quote.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>14. Seasonal Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Line striping services cannot be performed in temperatures below 10°C (50°F), during precipitation, or when surfaces are wet or expected to become wet within 24 hours of application. Winter or early spring scheduling is subject to weather-dependent confirmation. For winter services, indoor facilities, or projects requiring immediate completion regardless of weather conditions, please inquire about our premium quick-dry formula options (additional charges apply).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>15. Insurance Coverage</h2>
        <p>
          Titan Parking maintains comprehensive commercial general liability insurance to protect both our business and our clients. Upon request, we can provide a Certificate of Insurance prior to commencing work. Our insurance covers potential property damage that may occur during the execution of our services, but does not extend to pre-existing property conditions or damage caused by third parties after completion of our work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>17. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
          Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations where such failure or delay results from any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party. Such causes include, but are not limited to: power failure, internet service provider failure, industrial action, civil unrest, fire, flood, storms, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, acts of war, governmental action, pandemic, or any other event beyond the control of the party in question. If affected by such an event, the affected party shall inform the other party as soon as reasonably possible and propose alternative dates for service.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>18. Equipment and Property Protection</h2>
        <p>
          The client agrees to take reasonable precautions to protect Titan Parking's equipment and personnel while on the client's property. This includes ensuring safe access to work areas, providing notice of any known hazards, and preventing unauthorized persons from interfering with our work. Clients are responsible for communicating with their tenants, employees, or customers regarding the scheduled work to minimize disruptions and potential conflicts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>19. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of any dispute or complaint regarding our services, the client agrees to notify Titan Parking in writing within 5 business days of service completion. We will respond within 48 hours and make reasonable efforts to address valid concerns. Before initiating any legal action, both parties agree to attempt resolution through direct negotiation and, if necessary, mediation through a mutually agreed-upon third party in Quebec.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>20. Completed Work Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          Upon completion of the work, the client will be given the opportunity to inspect the work performed. Unless the client notifies Titan Parking of any deficiencies within 48 hours of job completion, the work shall be deemed accepted. For jobs completed during non-business hours, photos of completed work will be provided, and the same 48-hour inspection period applies from the time the photos are delivered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>21. Vehicle and Property Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          While Titan Parking takes all reasonable precautions to prevent damage, we cannot be held responsible for damage to vehicles that remain in the work area after the client has been notified to clear the area. Similarly, we are not responsible for tracking of wet paint by pedestrians or vehicles that enter marked work areas despite caution signs and barriers. The client acknowledges responsibility for securing the work area against unauthorized entry during the paint curing period as instructed by our crew.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>22. Quebec Civil Code Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          This agreement is governed by the laws of Quebec, including the Quebec Civil Code. In accordance with Quebec law, our services aim to comply with all applicable provincial regulations, including those related to accessibility and safety markings. While we strive to provide services that meet all regulatory requirements, the client acknowledges their ultimate responsibility for ensuring their property complies with current Quebec regulations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>23. Quality Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Titan Parking is committed to providing the highest quality line striping services using professional equipment, premium materials, and experienced technicians. We stand behind our workmanship and aim to develop long-term relationships with our clients through superior service, reliability, and attention to detail. We recommend regular maintenance schedules to maximize the lifespan and appearance of your pavement markings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>24. Documentation and Records</h2>
        <p>
          Upon request, we will provide clients with documentation regarding work performed, including before and after photos, materials used, and appropriate maintenance recommendations. Clients should maintain these records for warranty purposes and future reference. For commercial properties subject to accessibility audits or insurance inspections, this documentation may serve as proof of compliance with current standards at the time of service.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="legal-section-content">
        <h2>25. Communication and Project Management</h2>
        <p>
          The client agrees to designate a primary contact person who has authority to make decisions regarding the project. This person should be available during the scheduled work period either on-site or by phone. Titan Parking will provide updates on project status, any issues encountered, and expected completion times. We request that any changes to project scope or specifications be made in writing to avoid misunderstandings.
